# Kinect

SUMMARY
———————
This project details the installation and the programming of the Microsoft Kinect using Libfreekinect, OpenNI, NITE as well as PyOpenNI on an ubuntu-15.10 system. 

Installation
————————————

The installation of all the files was done on a clean install of ubuntu-15.10. There is no guarantee that this would work on other distributions especially versions of Ubuntu earlier than Ubuntu 10.x. It also seems that installation instructions have a lifespan, so these instructions may no longer be valid in the future. They do work as of 28 March 2017. 

**sudo apt-get update**

**sudo apt-get install git-core cmake python-dev python-numpy freeglut3-dev pkg-config build-essential libxmu-dev libxi-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libgtk2.0-dev doxygen graphviz**

**mkdir ~/kinect**
**cd ~/kinect**
